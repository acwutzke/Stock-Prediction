# XGBoost Stock Price Prediction

Stock prediction using XGBoost! This project attempts to classify stocks that will go up by more than 5% in the next 10 days.

## Requirements
- pandas, numpy, datetime, matplotlib
- xgboost
- sklearn

## Project Structure
- `configuration.py` : location to specify global variables used in `training.py` and `eval.py` scripts.
- `training.py` : script to train a model based on the variables set in `configuration.py`.
- `eval.py` : script to give AUC/ROC curve, precision, recall, average gain, and chart backtest performance agains benchmark.
- `xgb_functions.py` and `eval_functions.py` contain supporting functions that are used in other scripts.

## `configuration.py`

This file contains variables used in other `training.py` and `eval.py` scripts. It has the following variables:

### **Training variables:**

**ticker_list_file** : *string, default='ticker_lists/TOPTSX.csv'* \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Specify the name of the ticker list which is a CSV file holding a list of stock symbols (ex. AAPL, TSLA, MSFT)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several ticker lists are included in the ticker_lists/ folder. See below for more information about these lists.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You create and use your own ticker list if you choose.

### ticker_exchange : *string, default=''*
  Suffix for stocks on exchanges outside of the US. For example, use '.TO' for stocks on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX).
  Leave blank unless downloading TSX stocks ('.TO')

### ticker_sample_size : *int, default='all'*
  Must me an integer unless choosing 'all' stocks in ticker list.

### training_data_start : *string, default='2015-01-01'*
	Start date of training data - must me in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD'

### training_data_end: *string, default='2019-12-31'*
	End date of training data - must me in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD'

### test_data_start= *string, default='2020-01-01'*
	Start date of test data - must me in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD'
	Note that the test data period should be different than the training data period.

### test_data_end=*string, default='2021-03-20'*
	End date of test data - must me in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD'
	Note that the test data period should be different than the training data period.

### save_model : *bool, default=True*
	Determines whether the model created will be saved after training.
	Models will be saved to the models/ folder.

### model_name : *string, default='test_model'*
	Name model will be saved with.

### index : *string, default='SPY'*
	Choose index related to the ticker list for feature calculation and evaluation.
	'SPY' is the symbol for S&P 500 which represents the overall performance of the market.
	If training a model on a specific industry, an industry specific index may be more appropriate.

### **Evaluation variables**

### eval_model_name : *string, default='test_model'*
	Specify model to be evaluated.
	Model must me located in the models/ folder.

### show_auc_roc_curve : *bool, default=False*
	Specify whether to show AUC ROC curve.

### show_prec_recall : *bool, default=False*
	Specify whether to show precision recall information.

### **Backtest**
	Backtest uses predictions generated by the model to simulate how a portfolio would have performed if stocks
	were purchased based on model predictions. For example if backtest_conf = 0.5 and backtest_max_positions = 5
	the model will purchase up to 5 stocks provided that the model prediction probability is over 0.5. If there are 
	more than 5 stocks with a model prediction over 0.5, the stocks with the highest prediciton probability are 
	purchased. After 10 trading days, regardless of performance, stocks previously purchased are sold with a gain
	or loss, and new stocks are purchased.

### show_backtest: *bool, default=True*
	Specify whether to perform backtest.

### backtest_conf : *float, default=0.5*
	Minimum confidence level necessary for a stock to be purchased.
### backtest_max_positions : *int, default=5*
	Max number of stocks that will be held at any given time during the backtest.
### backtest_cash : *int, float, default=100000*
	Starting hypothetical cash for back test.
### backtest_index : *string, default='SPY'*
	Index to be used as a benchmark to compare model portfolio performance.
### backtest_title : *string, default='Backtest Result'*
